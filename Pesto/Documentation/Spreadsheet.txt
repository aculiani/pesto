Libraries for reading / manipulating spreadsheets:

NPOI - 
	Simple text extraction works on all sheets, removes empty lines and cells. 
	Complicated extraction does not handle some time formats correctly

GemBox - Free version only supports 150 rows and 5 sheets. Do they provide a free version without restrictions for non-profit projects?
